## **How computers work?**

*Comuter* around the world change our live,computer would need to be designed to manipulate information.
The computer was created to do for **different tasks**:
1. Take input
2. Storag information
3. Broecessing
4. Output the result

Thats make the *computer* computer.computer started out as a calculator.The old computer is different than those days computers, but it is still  doing the same four tasks.

## How do computers work in the inside?
The computer deals with different types like numbers text image sounds, The computer represented with numbers and the represented is the other types. Every input or output from computer is a types of information Which can be represented by on and off Electra signals Or 1 and 0.
There are input devices that take input from the outside world and convert it into binary information.
* There is memory to store this information.
* There's a central processing unit or CPU,
* And, finally, there are output devices that take information and convert it into a physical output.

When you look inside a computing device you see a bunch of circuits, chips, wires,speakers, plugs, and all sorts of other stuff This is the _**hardware**_.
_**Software**_ is all of the computer programs, or code, running on this machine.

## But how do the hardware and the software interact with one another?
The CPU is the master chip that controls all the other parts of the computer.CPU A CPU needs to do different things so inside it has smaller, simpler parts that handle specific tasks.It has circuits to do simple math and logic.It has other circuits to send and receive information to and from different parts of the computer.
The real magic of the CPU is how it knows which circuits to use and when to use them.
The CPU receives simple commands that tell it which circuit to use to do a specific job.
