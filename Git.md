using git to like the global gitHub repo with local which is in the computer
we have to Add, Commit and push (ACP) if we want to keep our work safe and make sure we could reache thim from anywhere and protect it.
to push repo to local there is steps to follw :
* copy the clone URL
* type code .
* git status ( it would show you the chandes that happened )
* write git commit _m "your file name"
* type git push origin master 
and thats it. 


what I got from reading about remote is a technique to make two or more user work in the same project in different placeses 
By using git remote -v, you can view all the remote URLs next to their corresponding short names
