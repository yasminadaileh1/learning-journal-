## Git

Git it's version control system help us mange our project's file.
let's imagine that we are building a new website so we will have all kind of files such HTML, CSS, JS, images, etc..
Git help us to have a history of changes collabration and feature brenches which mean working in two task or more in the same timeang go live after finishing any task.

project mean repository
commit mean save

we use coding attribut such as:
* mkdir to creat directory
* ls to get file listed 
* cd to enter the file
* cd.. to exit the file
* pwd to see where are you

using git to link the global gitHub repo with local which is in the computer
we have to Add, Commit and push (ACP) if we want to keep our work safe and make sure we could reache thim from anywhere and protect it.
to push repo to local there is steps to follw :
* copy the clone URL
* type code .
* git status ( it would show you the chandes that happened )
* write git commit _m "your file name"
* type git push origin master 
and thats it. 


what I got from reading about remote is a technique to make two or more user work in the same project in different placeses 
By using git remote -v, you can view all the remote URLs next to their corresponding short names
