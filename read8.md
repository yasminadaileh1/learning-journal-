## Operators and Loops in javascript

**COMPARISON OPERATORS: EVALUATING CONDITIONS.**
You can evaluate a situation by comparing one value in the script to what you expect it might be. The result will be a Boolean: true or false.
1. * = = * *IS EQUAL TO*

2. ! =  *IS NOT EQUAL TO*

3. = = =  *STRICT EQUAL TO*

4. ! = = STRICT NOT EQUAL TO*

5. < *LESS THAN*

6. > *GREATER THAN*

7. < = *LESS THAN OR EQUAL TO*

8. > = *GREATER THAN OR EQUAL TO*


## **LOGICAL OPERATORS**
Comparison operators usually return single values of true or false. Logical operators allow you to compare the results of more than one comparison operator.
* & & LOGICAL AND
* | | LOGICAL OR
* ! LOGICAL NOT

### *LOOPS*
Loops check a condition. If it returns true, a code block will run. Then the condition will be checked again and if it still returns true, the code block will run again. It repeats until the condition returns false. There are three common types of loops:
1. FOR
2. WHILE
3. DO WHILE
