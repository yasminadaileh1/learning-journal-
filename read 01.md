## markdown 

Files with the .md or .markdown extension

there is syntax to styling words, I see it look like CSS 
for header use ## 
bold **befor and after the word you want to bold it
*befor and after the word that would make the line in itlaic style
and for listing we could use * or - 
and many many attributes
